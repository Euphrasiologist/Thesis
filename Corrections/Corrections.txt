Max Brown Thesis Corrections (24.04.21)
---------------------------------------
This document details the changes to the thesis post-viva. The numbered sections contain the examiners points. Actions to each point are under the "actions" subheader.

1. In the introduction, we request that you explain more fully how the various chapters fit together to address the aims. This could take the form of a narrative explanation with questions (and hypotheses) at the end of chapter 1.

Actions:
- Section 1.8 - expansion of paragraph 1 on p19. Expansion also of paragraph 2 of this section, adding questions.

2. In Chapter 2, we request that you expand on the mechanistic explanations of how polyploidy can act as a barrier to both hybrid formation and gene flow. We suggest that these mechanisms can be placed into a conceptual framework that also includes isolating mechanisms that do not relate to ploidy. This will greatly improve the impact of this important review.

Actions:
- p21 Section 2.2 - Paragraph 1 has been split into two. The first paragraph now contains more detail on reproductive barriers to cross species hybridisation.

3. In Chapter 3, we request that you discuss the fact that the observation of hybridisation is distinct from the occurrence of gene flow. 

Actions:
- Section 3.2 - 3rd paragraph on p44 After "In this study we characterise... or archaeophytes" a sentence of clarity is added to say hybrids "are putative based on morphology", and that sequences are only from putative parental progenitors.
- search "hybridisation" and "gene flow" and make sure they are used in the right context.
- Throughout this chapter, changed all instances of 'pairwise combinations' to 'pairwise parental combinations'.

4. In Chapter 4, we request that you discuss how the model fitting analysis performed using dadi may have been impacted by an insufficient number of SNPs, especially considering the failure to find optimal parameters in two of the models.

Actions:
- p60 Section 4.3.6 after first sentence, add 'while we acknowledge that a limited number of SNPs were generated, these analyses should be able to tell us the difference between scenarios of gene flow'. Additional citation (Hartmann et al 2020).
- p65 Section 4.4.4 - added a sentence on concrete conclusions limited due to the low number of SNPs. This same point is also now mentioned in the discussion.

5. We request that Chapter 5 be made an appendix. 

Actions:
- now p185 Placed in appendix, and updated to most recent version. Note that it contains its own bibliography.

6. In chapter 7 (now 6), we request that you provide an expanded and more nuanced discussion of the findings with respect to functional groups.

Actions:
- Section 6.5 paragraph 1 contains an expanded discussion of functional group. "Functional groups... future analyses".
- The whole manuscript was revised since it was sent to review at New Phytologist. This was initially rejected and and reviewed accordingly. The new discussion includes expansion on functional groups.

7. We request that you rewrite the general discussion, placing your thesis in the broader context of
the field, and describing if and how it changes our understanding of the field.

Actions:
- p99 A paragraph now inserted at the very start of the discussion.
